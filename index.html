My interests lie in data science and quantitative economics, as well as enabling the same for others. On these pages, you can find some of my work. All opinions expressed are my own.<br><br>

I work at the Bank of Finland in a hybrid role. On the one hand, I'm a Data Scientist promoting data science culture and capabilities. On the other hand, I'm a Quantitative Economist focusing on financial stability and the analysis of microdata. I've previously worked in other government organizations and the banking industry.
<br><br>

I'm defending my PhD in Economics in spring 2026 at the University of Helsinki. My research focuses on central banking using microdata.
