My interests lie in data science and quantitative economics, as well as enabling the same for others. On these pages, you can find some of my work. All opinions expressed are my own.<br><br>

Professionally, I work at the Bank of Finland in a hybrid role. On the one hand, I'm a Data Scientist promoting data science culture and capabilities. On the other hand, I'm a Quantitative Economist focusing on financial stability and the analysis of microdata. Previously, I've worked in private banks and government organizations.
<br><br>

I'm also a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Helsinki. My research focuses on empirical banking.
