I'm an interpreter of financial stability, quantitative analysis, and data science. I am passionate about explaining the world through quantitative analysis and love bringing data to life. On these pages you can find some of my work. All opinions expressed are my own.<br><br>

Professionally, I work at the Bank of Finland in a hybrid role. On the one hand, I'm a Data Scientist who promotes data science culture and capabilities at the enterprise level. On the other hand, I'm a Quantitative Economist focusing on financial stability and analysis of micro data. Previously I've worked in private banks and governmental organizations.
<br><br>

I'm also a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Helsinki. My research focuses on empirical banking.
